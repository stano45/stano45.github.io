				<p>
					In this article, I will talk about my experience during my computer
					science (Informatik) bachelor&apos;s program at TU Berlin. I will go
					through everything I had to do to get my degree, including compulsory
					and voluntary courses, seminars, projects and the thesis. I will try
					my best to structure this in the most informative way possible and
					provide advice and tips to future students.
				</p>
				<p>
					This article might be interesting for anyone applying to or starting
					their CS program at TU Berlin. With that being said, I studied between
					winter semester 2020 until summer semester 2024, using the 2015 StuPO
					(study regulation). Some things might have changed, so please make
					sure to review the regulations that apply to you and use this article
					only as a rough guide for things to come.
				</p>
				<p>
					I will skip talking about the application process, since this is
					different for everyone, mostly based on their country of origin.
					Please check the university&apos;s website well in advance to ensure
					you have gathered all the required documents, certificates, and
					reports to ensure a smooth process.

				/>
				<p>
					The university provides a recommended study plan for computer science.
					I strongly recommend you stick to it, if you want to complete your
					studies in 3 years. Only deviate from this if you have a very good
					reason to do so (such as relevant part-time work, unexpected events,
					etc).
				</p>
				<p>
					There are multiple categories of courses that you will have to take.
					For each category, there is a prescribed number of credits you will
					have to earn. The categories are:
				</p>
				<ul className="ml-6 list-disc">
					<li>
						<strong>
							Compulsory courses (all the courses with their name explicitly
							stated in the above table):
						</strong>{" "}
						these are the very basics of computer science, and you will have to
						take all of them.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>
							Wahlpflicht Technische Informatik (Compulsory Elective):
						</strong>{" "}
						In this category, you will have to take one 6-credit course focusing
						on technical computer science.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Wahlpflicht Programmierpraktikum:</strong> Same as above,
						but for a programming project.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Wahlpflicht Theoretische Informatik:</strong> Same as above,
						only for theoretical computer science courses.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Wahlpflichtbereich Katalog Informatik:</strong> Here, you
						can take any courses from computer science bachelor&apos;s or
						master&apos;s, no matter the classification (theoretical, practical,
						technical). You can choose to either specialize when you know what
						you want to do (e.g. software engineering, theory, game
						development), OR you can simply just try out different stuff to see
						what catches your interest.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Wahlbereich:</strong> This is a completely optional
						category. You can take any course from any study course, not limited
						to computer science. Here, you can explore other disciplines. You
						can also take courses taught at other partner universities of the
						Berlin University Alliance - such as the Humboldt UniversitÃ¤t or
						Freie UniversitÃ¤t! Of course, you can also choose to be a nerd like
						me and only pick CS related stuff ðŸ˜€
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Bachelorarbeit:</strong> This is your bachelor&apos;s
						thesis. I will explain how this (usually) works and describe my
						experience in a later section of this article.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Now, you might be wondering where to find the courses. TU Berlin
					provides 2 web portals to access and register for courses:
				</p>
				<ul className="ml-6 list-disc">
					<li>
						<a
							href="https://moseskonto.tu-berlin.de/moses/"
							className="text-blue-500 underline"
						>
							<strong>Moses</strong>
						</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a
							href="https://isis.tu-berlin.de/"
							className="text-blue-500 underline"
						>
							<strong>ISIS (no, it&apos;s not what you thinkâ€¦)</strong>
						</a>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					I won&apos;t go into detail on how to use them, as the university does
					a good enough job already. Just remember that Moses is used for
					browsing courses, registering for exams, and signing up for tutorials.
					Isis is used for enrolling in courses, watching lectures, and doing
					online tests.
				</p>
				<InsiderTip content="You can browse courses in Moses even before you get your login details!" />
				<p>Now, let&apos;s finally get into studying!</p>
				<BlogPostHeading>Early Bird</BlogPostHeading>
				<p>
					Before the first semester even starts, the university offers the{" "}
					<a
						href="https://www.tu.berlin/math/mathe-service/kurse-und-module"
						className="text-blue-500 underline"
					>
						<strong>Early Bird I</strong>
					</a>{" "}
					course for engineering majors. This means you can take the
					&quot;Analysis I und lineare Algebra&quot; math course during the
					summer before your first semester. This course is compressed to around
					8â€“10 weeks, and you will have to:
				</p>
				<ul className="ml-6 list-disc">
					<li>Watch one lecture a day,</li>
					<li>Complete one quiz a day,</li>
					<li>Work on a written homework every 3 days (with 2 teammates),</li>
					<li>
						Optionally join daily tutorials if you need assistance from tutors.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					At the end, you will take an exam, which will determine your final
					grade.
				</p>
				<p>
					Again, this information is based on the version of the course I took
					in 2020, so make sure to review the university&apos;s websites.
				</p>
				<p>
					Whether you should take this course really depends on your goals. The
					pros of taking it are:
				</p>
				<ul className="ml-6 list-disc">
					<li>
						You are going to be well prepared for your studies and get
						comfortable with the university course format (lectures, homework,
						tutorials), even before the first semester,
					</li>
					<li>
						You get rid of 12 (!) credits for the first semester. That&apos;s
						almost half of the recommended 27!
					</li>
					<li>You get to take other courses during the first semesterâ€¦</li>
					<li>
						â€¦which means it will be way easier to complete the program in the
						recommended 6 semesters.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Now of course, taking this course means you basically will not have
					time for anything else for most of your summer. This course takes a
					full 8hr/day commitment for the whole duration.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you asked me for my opinion, I would strongly recommend this course
					if you want to get a strong start into your bachelor&apos;s and make
					your first semester less stressful. Thanks to Early Bird, I was able
					to take another course in my first semester, and got to enjoy my first
					months in Berlin without much stress.
				</p>

				<ImageWrapper
					imagePath="/ernst-reuter.jpg"
					description="Ernst-Reuter Platz in winter"
				/>
				<ImageWrapper imagePath="/semester1.png" />
				<p>
					The first semester will be easy or hard based on your previous
					experience with computer science and programming, and whether you have
					completed Early Bird.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you have limited experience in programming and don&apos;t plan on
					taking Early Bird, no worries at all! If you stay engaged with the
					lectures and do your homework, you will have no problems passing exams
					with good grades. You don&apos;t need to be a genius either. All it
					takes is consistent, incremental effort during the whole semester.
				</p>
				<p>
					Based on the recommended study plan, there are 4 compulsory courses
					you should take:
				</p>
				<BlogPostHeading level="h3">
					{" "}
					EinfÃ¼hrung in die Programmierung (IntroProg)
				</BlogPostHeading>
				<p>
					This is the first programming course of the degree. When I took it, we
					had to take a 2 week crash course in C, with a small assignment every
					day. During this crash course, we learned all fundamental programming
					language constructs. After the crash course, we learned about basic
					algorithms and data structures, as well as how to determine complexity
					and correctness of computer programs.
				</p>
				<InsiderTip
					content="This is a very important course, and almost ALL concepts you learn will repeat in many following courses (as well as in your future career). Be
          careful to complete and understand every exercise, as this can really make your life easier later, and also
          help you prepare for the exam at the end."
				/>
				<BlogPostHeading level="h3">Rechnerorganisation (ROrg)</BlogPostHeading>
				<p>
					You will basically learn how the compiler translates C code into
					(MIPS) assembly and how code is executed on a (pipelined) processor.
					You will also learn the basics about hardware organization, or in
					other words how different components of the computer interact with
					each other to process instructions. This course is really cool because
					you start to understand what the computer does when you run your code.
				</p>
				<InsiderTip

				<BlogPostHeading level="h3">Informatik PropÃ¤deutikum</BlogPostHeading>
				<p>
					This course is a mix of various different topics, including the basics
					of theoretical computer science, data structures, algorithms and even
					scientific work. It&apos;s a very chill course, focusing on a broad
					variety of topics. I would call it the &quot;Introduction to
					Bachelor&apos;s of Computer Science&quot;.
				</p>
				<BlogPostHeading level="h3">
					Analysis I und lineare Algebra (AnaLina)
				</BlogPostHeading>
				<p>
					This is the first math course you will take. If you can, take it in
					Early Bird, but doing it normally is also fine. Even though you think
					you might not use most of the knowledge from this course, you will be
					very surprised how often these concepts come up in other completely
					unrelated courses.
				</p>
				<p>
					Based on what I&apos;ve seen during the first semester, the two
					courses that most students struggle with in the first semester are
					IntroProg and AnaLina. As I already mentioned, it&apos;s not
					necessarily because the students aren&apos;t bright enough or CS
					isn&apos;t right for them. Most of the time, they underestimated the
					small things and incremental progress, and then got a shock a couple
					of days or weeks before exams.{" "}
				</p>
				<p>
					The first semester is largely about getting accustomed to learning in
					&quot;university format&quot;, which is very different from high
					school. A lot of students fail because they don&apos;t understand
					this. Make sure to build a solid system for studying early on.
				</p>
				<InsiderTip
					content='If you have taken the Early Bird course, you will have plenty of space to take an
          additional course or two. However, it can be hard to decide on what you can take from the later semesters and
          not fail. I recommend taking the "Wissenschaftliches Rechnen" course from the 3rd semester. This
          course builds largely on the linear algebra part of AnaLina, and since you&apos;ve taken Early Bird, this
          material will still be fresh in your memory. Be careful if you have never coded before though, because you
          will have to write a lot of Python code in this course. If you want to take it easy, you can take a voluntary
          or compulsory elective course, which has no prerequisites.'

					Now, you should already have an idea how everything works, and

					a couple of (pretty exciting) courses in the second semester, all of
					which are mandatory:
				</p>
				<BlogPostHeading level="h3">
					Systemprogrammierung (SysProg)
				</BlogPostHeading>
				<p>
					This course explains the basics of operating systems, such as
					processor scheduling, memory allocation, interrupts, threads and much
					more. I must admit, this was one of my favorite courses from the
					fundamentals, with a bunch of fun practical exercises.
				</p>
				<InsiderTip content="Find a solid team for the exercises, otherwise you won't have a good time." />
				<BlogPostHeading level="h3">
					Algorithmen und Datenstrukturen (AlgoDat)
				</BlogPostHeading>
				<p>
					This is the second programming course, this time in Java (at least
					when I took it). Expect a lot of practical exercises to make yourself
					familiar with classical algorithms and data structures. You can see
					this course as an extension of IntroProg.
				</p>
				<InsiderTip
					content="I will repeat myself again, but I cannot stress enough how important the exercises are. It's
          crucial to understand all concepts deeply to pass the exam."
				/>
				<BlogPostHeading level="h3">
					Informationssysteme und Datenanalyse (ISDA)
				</BlogPostHeading>
				<p>
					This is basically the database course. You will learn a bunch of
					theoretical background for how databases work, such as relation,
					entities, entity types, query languages etc. I must admit I
					didn&apos;t pay much attention in this course because I found it easy,
					but then I regretted it in my actual engineering part time job. The
					material is really valuable to understand database systems at a deeper
					level.
				</p>
				<BlogPostHeading level="h3">
					Formale Sprachen und Automaten (ForSA)
				</BlogPostHeading>
				<p>
					This is the first serious theoretical computer science course. You
					will learn various logical constructs, as well as grammars, formal
					languages and automata.
				</p>
				<InsiderTip
					content='This is one of the "great filter" courses, which means a LOT of students fail. In my
          opinion, the reason is because the lecture goes at a really fast pace, and if you missed something in the
          beginning, it&apos;s super hard to catch up again. Make sure to pay extra attention at the beginning, and your
          knowledge will build up nicely. Also, start on the homework early and plan sessions in advance with your
          teammates.'
				/>
				<BlogPostHeading level="h3">Diskrete Strukturen (DS)</BlogPostHeading>
				<p>

				<ImageWrapper imagePath="/semester3.png" />
				<p>
					Welcome to the dreaded 3rd semester. This one seems to be consistently
					the hardest one. But as I&apos;ve said before, if you put in the work,
					you can pass it on your first try without major issues.
				</p>
				<p>
					But look on the bright side: once you pass this semester, the courses
					start to be more laid back, and you will actually have a choice in
					what you take! So let&apos;s dive into it:
				</p>
				<BlogPostHeading level="h3">
					Rechnernetze und verteilte Systeme (RNVS)
				</BlogPostHeading>
				<p>
					This course will teach you how the internet works. You will go in
					depth into various protocols on all layers of the internet stack, such
					as HTTP, TCP/IP, NAT, ARP, and much more. Everything is complemented
					with practical exercises in C.
				</p>
				<InsiderTip
					content="When I took this course, there were a bunch of practical exercises
          which were hard, but barely contributed to the final grade. This might not be the case anymore, but if it is,
          try to complete them, even though it might not be worth the points. Basic networking knowledge is useful in
          almost any CS field, and by working on these assignments you will get a deep understanding of the most
          important network protocols."
				/>
				<BlogPostHeading level="h3">
					Softwaretechnik und Programmierparadigmen (SWTTP)
				</BlogPostHeading>
				<p>
					Here you will learn a bunch of software engineering concepts, such as
					OOP, various software architectures, but also management concepts such
					as Agile, Scrum, Kanban, etc. You will also code in Haskell (a
					functional language) and Prolog (a logic programming language). When I
					took the course, there were two larger programming exercises, the
					first to build the backend for a chess game and the second one to
					build a chess bot using Haskell. Overall a very practical and useful
					course. Wissenschaftliches Rechnen (WiRe) As mentioned before, I took
					this course in the first semester. This course is basically practical
					linear algebra in various contexts, with a bunch of practical
					exercises in python.
				</p>
				<InsiderTip

				<BlogPostHeading level="h3">
					Berechenbarkeit und KomplexitÃ¤t (BeKo)
				</BlogPostHeading>
				<p>
					Now we get into the spicy courses. This is probably the most important
					theoretical computer science course you will take. Also one of the
					hardest. You will explore classical topics such as turing machines and
					computability, recursion, the halting problem, P and NP, problem
					reductions and complexity analysis.
				</p>
				<InsiderTip
					content="There is really difficult homework in this course. Make sure to start on it

				/>
				<BlogPostHeading level="h3">Logik</BlogPostHeading>
				<p>
					In my opinion, this was the hardest course of the whole program. This
					course teaches you about advanced logical structures and reasoning. If
					you&apos;re not used to this kind of stuff (as I wasn&apos;t at the
					time of taking it), you will spend a lot of time on studying. You
					should use the same strategy as with ForSA (in the 2nd semester),
					putting extra effort at the start, and watching the knowledge build up
					after.
				</p>
				<InsiderTip
					content="This course also includes homework, and it's difficult.
          I don't think I've heard of anyone in my circle that got a good grade on this one. So the same advice

					If you&apos;ve made it up to this point: a genuine congratulations!
					It&apos;s most likely going to be smooth sailing from now on. You have
					passed almost all of the prescribed compulsory courses and get to
					choose what you want to do (for the most part). Therefore, from this
					point I&apos;m only going to talk about the course I have chosen for
					each category.
				</p>
				<BlogPostHeading level="h3">
					Wahlpflicht Technische Informatik - Verteilte Systeme (VS)
				</BlogPostHeading>
				<p>
					I chose the Distributed Systems course because of its practicality,
					but also partly because of the professor who was teaching. I
					thoroughly enjoyed both SysProg and RNVS and wanted to expand my
					knowledge in this area. This was one of the best choices I made during
					my Bachelor&apos;s as this course quickly became my most favorite from
					the entire program.
				</p>

				<p>
					It was a wonderful mix of distributed systems theory, and a lot of
					practical exercise. The implementation of some of them was completely
					up to us. This was my first time having so much freedom during an
					assignment, and me and my teammates had so much fun with the
					implementation. We implemented everything in Go, which was also a
					great choice, because now I use almost everything I learned in my part
					time software engineering job.
				</p>

				<p>
					In addition to the practicality of the course, the professor organized
					a weekly discussion on the material, in which we could freely think
					about questions and discuss them. What I really valued was that there
					was no right or wrong answer, and everyone felt like a part of the
					discussion. In summary, this course basically shaped my studies from
					this point on, and also my career interests. Strongly recommended if
					you&apos;re into distributed systems, or software engineering in
					general.
				</p>
				<BlogPostHeading level="h3">
					Wahlpflicht Programmierpraktikum - Verteilte Systeme
				</BlogPostHeading>
				<p>
					No this isn&apos;t a mistake, I took another course of the same name.
					It&apos;s not the same course though, and this one focused solely on
					developing a full stack application in a team of 5 people. We
					organized ourselves in a classic agile setup, with weekly meetings,
					sprint plannings and retros. This was super fun because it was my
					first look into how software engineering teams are usually organized,
					and how to collaborate closely with teammates to achieve predefined
					goals.

				</BlogPostHeading>
				<p>
					I chose algorithm theory, because I enjoyed coming up with algorithms
					and analyzing them. This is basically all this course is, but also
					includes some problem reductions you learned from BeKo. The knowledge
					from this course is super useful when you are grinding LeetCode or
					HackerRank while preparing for a job interview. In retrospect, the

					for me, as that one is well applicable to distributed systems.

					You might be wondering why I combined three semesters in one.
					It&apos;s definitely not because I&apos;m lazy. It&apos;s because you
					can take your courses in any order, with an exception to
					&quot;Informatik und Gesellschaft&quot; and the thesis. I will talk
					about the thesis in a later section.
				</p>
				<p>
					You also might be asking why there is a seventh semester. This is
					because I took fewer courses in one semester, and focused more on my
					part-time job. Honestly, <b>this was a bad decision</b>, and if you
					are thinking about doing this, I would suggest you avoid it and try to
					simply manage your time better. After finishing the
					&quot;lighter&quot; semester, I realized I actually could have taken
					more courses and managed my work next to it too. If you have a part
					time job and the time gets tight, simply push through it, work on the
					weekend if you have to, and you will feel much better when you finish
					your program in 3 years.
				</p>
				<p>
					With that being said, let&apos;s look at the courses in the last three
					semesters. Again, these were all my choice (with an exception to
					&quot;Informatik und Gesellschaft&quot;), so your set of courses might
					look completely different.
				</p>
				<BlogPostHeading level="h3">
					Informatik und Gesellschaft or Information Governance (IG)
				</BlogPostHeading>
				<p>
					You will learn basic economics, law, data protection, some business
					models and also ethics. This is one of the most useful courses in the
					program, which does not directly focus on programming or computer
					science. Basically everything you learn is useful to know and will
					help you in your career as well as everyday life.

				<BlogPostHeading level="h3">
					Wahlpflicht - Continuous Software Engineering
				</BlogPostHeading>
				<p>
					This course was made up of three parts: lecture, seminar and practical
					assignment. In the lecture, we learned the basics of cloud native
					software, including orchestration, deployment, testing, tracing and
					much more. In the seminar part, we had to write a 10-page report, in
					our case on serverless and infrastructure as code. The goal of the
					practical assignment was to take an existing microservice application,
					and extend it with a new microservice. This course provided a lot of
					insight into the world of cloud native software, and made us
					understand how the cloud really works. We also got to work with a

					your own paper. After that, you present your results. A seminar gives
					you an insight into the academic world, and also teaches you
					scientific writing, which is later helpful when writing your thesis.

					Wahlbereich - Programmierpraktikum: Moderne verteilte Anwendungen

				<p>
					Yes, I took another project - I like practical courses. You can take
					as many as you want during your program. Just make sure you don&apos;t
					take the spot of someone who needs it more than you. I joined this
					course after the official allocation was done, and there were multiple
					unoccupied spots. In this project, we implemented an AsyncAPI code
					generator in Rust. Again, this was a great practical experience, and I
					gained a lot of skills in Rust and team work. The generator was open
					sourced, and you can find it{" "}

					Wahlbereich - Analysis II fÃ¼r Ingenieurwissenschaften
				</BlogPostHeading>
				<p>
					This is a continuation of &quot;Analysis I und lineare Algebra&quot;,
					extending the analysis part. This course isn&apos;t required anymore
					in computer science, but I find math for engineers really interesting,
					because it&apos;s not purely theoretical, but rather filled with
					practical examples and exercises. This course also might be useful for
					someone pursuing a specialization where math is important. It&apos;s
					also offered as Early Bird II, in a similar format as AnaLina.

				<p>
					This is a completely practical project, and a big one. You get to
					choose from a selection of really interesting topics, sometimes even
					in cooperation with industrial partners. You work on the project in a
					team of 5â€“10 people. I chose the project focusing on{" "}

					: the low Earth orbit (LEO) edge emulator. I extended this emulator to
					support different satellite topologies, and built an external tool for
					calculating an optimal topology for satellite networks. I purposefully
					mentioned this one last, because it led me to my bachelor&apos;s
					thesis. I will talk about the thesis in the next section.

				<p>
					The last thing you will need to do to get your degree is to write a
					thesis. The university already does a good job about explaining how
					this process works formally - but for me it was unclear until the last
					moment how I can get a topic at all and what actions I should take to
					get an interesting topic.
				</p>
				<p>
					My advice for you is to start searching some months before your last
					semester, because the application process takes a while. Usually a
					month, but sometimes a bit longer. Some chairs also require you to
					have completed relevant courses before your thesis. Don&apos;t be
					afraid to ask, and be active in your search.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some courses and projects also naturally lead to a bachelor&apos;s
					thesis. This was true in my case. After completing the course
					Distributed Systems Prototyping, I asked my advisor whether they have
					any open topics at the{" "}
					<a
						href="https://www.tu.berlin/en/3s"
						className="text-blue-500 underline"
					>
						Scalable Software Systems chair
					</a>{" "}
					(formerly known as Mobile Cloud Computing - MCC), and they did. This
					led me to a super interesting topic, which made me really enjoy
					writing my thesis.

					Applying & Transitioning to Master&apos;s
				</BlogPostHeading>
				<p>
					If you want to continue with your masters, the university makes the
					transition really smooth. The only extra requirement you need to
					fulfill is an English language certificate. Otherwise, you will submit
					a couple of forms with your information, pay the semester fee as usual
					and you&apos;re in!
				</p>
				<p>
					Even if you&apos;re still not done with your thesis and waiting for
					the final 180 credits, you can apply using your current credit report,
					and then submit your degree later during your first master&apos;s
					semester.

				<p>
					Completing this degree was definitely worth all the time and effort.
					What I found the most valuable is how almost all subjects combine
					theoretical knowledge with practical experience. Whenever I talk about
					my courses with my colleagues, many of which have earned their degrees
					at prestigious universities in Germany or abroad, they are always
					surprised by the practicality of the subjects at TU Berlin. Almost
					every course gave me a great mindset to analyze a specific problem
					set, but also tools to solve problems whenever they pop up in real
					life.
				</p>
				<p>
					I&apos;ve seen TU Alumni work at almost every tech company on LinkedIn
					(in this little box saying &quot;X people from TU Berlin work
					here&quot;). I think this can definitely be attributed to the
					practicality of the courses. If you have an entrepreneurial spirit,
					there are also many opportunities for you here. Berlin is one of the
					best startup environments in Europe, and the university supports
					founders in the Entrepreneurship Center. One of my mentors from the
					mentoring program I mentioned earlier actually founded a successful
					startup this way!
				</p>
				<p>
					If you&apos;re on the fence about registering for this program, I
					encourage you to do it! I&apos;ve heard many people say that CS
					degrees are not necessary nowadays, because you can learn everything
					in online courses or at a boot camp. While that&apos;s true for very
					specific skills, such as a programming language, a framework or a
					popular tech stack, the theoretical background you get from this
					program is invaluable. The world of tech is moving at an insanely fast
					pace, and that has been amplified further by the recent AI
					breakthroughs. Overly specific skill sets become obsolete, but a
					strong theoretical background in computer science will be useful
					during your entire career.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you got this far in the article, I genuinely thank you for reading!
					If you are interested in this program, and have some questions,
					don&apos;t hesitate to reach out! I am happy to help.
