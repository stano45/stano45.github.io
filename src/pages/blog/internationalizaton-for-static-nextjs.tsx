      <div className="my-8 text-xl">
        While working on my personal website, I decided to add internationalization for fun. I wanted a simple language
        picker on the top right of the website, which would switch the top navbar‚Äôs strings to the translated versions.
      </div>
      <div className="mb-8 text-xl">
        I chose a tech stack for my website that was both simple and flexible in terms of styling:{' '}
        <strong>Next.js</strong> with <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> on the frontend, and GitHub Pages as the host. The
        &apos;s possible to statically generate the content (SSG). GitHub provides a fantastic{' '}
        <a
          href="https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/pages/nextjs.yml"
          className="text-blue-500 underline"
        >
          .yml template
        </a>{' '}
        for actions that handles everything for you; all you need to do is push the code to your repo, and voila,
        it&apos;s up and running.
      </div>
      <div className="mb-8 text-xl">
        Next.js has supported internationalization out of the box (
        <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/i18n-routing" className="text-blue-500 underline">
          since v10
        </a>
        ). With a few config files, your site will automatically redirect users to the appropriate{' '}
        <strong>sub-path</strong> or
        <strong> sub-domain</strong>. The user&apos;s preferred language will be detected automatically (if enabled),
        and they will be redirected accordingly. For instance, a user with French as their preferred language would be
        redirected from example.com to example.com/fr (sub-path) or example.fr (sub-domain).
      </div>
      <div className="mb-8 text-xl">
        However, Next.js doesn&apos;t provide the actual management of translations and hooks to integrate them into
        your application. Fortunately, there&apos;s a library specifically designed for this purpose:{' '}
        <a href="https://github.com/i18next/next-i18next" className="text-blue-500 underline">
          next-i18next
        </a>
        . With just a couple of lines of code, this library allows you to easily set up localization. There is a catch,
        though.
      </div>
      <h2 className="my-8 text-3xl font-bold">The catch</h2>
      <div className="mb-8 text-xl">
        As I mentioned earlier, we want to statically generate our site content. However, next-i18n provides
        translations via server-side rendering (SSR), which makes it impossible to export the site statically since we
        rely on network calls for our translations.
      </div>
      <div className="mb-8 text-xl">
        One option to provide translations locally is to route to another HTML page on changing language. So if we have
        3 languages which we want to support, we would have 3 versions of each page. This solution is not very elegant
        and definitely not scalable in the long run.
      </div>
      <div className="mb-8 text-xl">
        Luckily, some awesome folks built{' '}
        <a href="https://github.com/martinkr/next-export-i18n" className="text-blue-500 underline">
          next-export-18n
        </a>{' '}
        to address this exact issue. It provides convenient internationalization with a useTranslation hook, exactly as
        with i18next, but does not rely on SSR. It achieves this by saving the localization as a query parameter instead
        of using sub-paths or sub-domains.
      </div>
      <div className="mb-8 text-xl">
        I will not be providing a tutorial for the setup in this post, as the devs of the module have already done a
        great job explaining it in the readme of their repo. However, I want to show how I integrated this into my site.
      </div>
      <div className="mb-8 text-xl">
        The languages that I support on my website are English, German, Slovak and Swedish. I created a
        translations.X.json file for each of the languages, where the X is the 2-letter code of the language. As the
        module supports nesting in the .json files, I split up my translations into views, such as home, about, etc.
      </div>
      <CopyBlock text={translations} language={'json'} theme={dracula} showLineNumbers />

      <div className="my-8 text-xl">
        Then, in each component, I used the useTranslation hook and picked the right localization string using t(), e.g.
        t(‚Äòview.title‚Äô).
      </div>
      <CopyBlock text={component} language={'typescript'} theme={dracula} showLineNumbers />

      <div className="my-8 text-xl">
        I also created a minimal language picker, which you can reuse{' '}
        <a
          className="text-blue-500 underline"

        . But since you&apos;re reading this, you get an exclusive chance to check it out live on this very site, in the{' '}
        <button className="text-blue-500 underline" onClick={scrollToTop}>
          {' '}

      <h2 className="my-8 text-xl font-bold">Summary</h2>

      <div className="mb-8 text-xl">
        With the help of <a href="https://github.com/martinkr/next-export-i18n">next-export-i18n</a>, you can easily add
        internationalization to a <strong>statically exported </strong> Next.js site, without relying on server-side
        rendering. The library allows convenient localization with a useTranslation hook and saves the localization as a
        query parameter instead of using sub-paths or sub-domains.
